# Examples

This directory contains some usage examples for the `aws-sso-device-auth-provider` package.

## [`s3-list`](./s3-list) - List S3 buckets

The simplest usage. Guides the user through the AWS SSO Device Authorization flow to obtain credentials to list the S3 buckets in the hardcoded account.

Hardcoded for use by employees of Echobox, since they're likely to be the first users of this package :)
